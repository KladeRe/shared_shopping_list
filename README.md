# shared_shopping_list
A shopping list web application made using Deno, Docker and javascript

This is a shopping list application that uses three-tier architecture and a layered architecture with five layers (views, controllers, services, database, utils).


## Running project locally

The project can also be tested locally by downloading all the necessary files. After that you switch to the root directory (the directory where the app.js is) and execute the command `docker-compose up`.
If `docker-compose up` doesn't work you most likely need to run it with root privileges `sudo docker-compose up`.
